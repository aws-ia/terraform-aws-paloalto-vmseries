# Example configuration of Palo Alto Networks VM-Series on AWS

The following example deploys a VM-Series Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) to the AWS Cloud using the [user data bootstrap method](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/10-0/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall/choose-a-bootstrap-method.html#idf6412176-e973-488e-9d7a-c568fe1e33a9_id3433e9c0-a589-40d5-b0bd-4bc42234aa0f). It launches two instances of NGFW, each with three Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). Use this example to familiarize yourself with the module. For more complex examples, refer to the  [Examples](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-aws-vmseries-modules/tree/develop/examples) directory in this repository.

**NOTE:**
The security group attached to the management interface uses an inbound rule allowing traffic to port `22` and `443` from `0.0.0.0/0`, which means that SSH and HTTP access to the NFGW is possible from the Internet. You should update the security group rules to limit access to the management interface, for example, to only the public IP address from which you will connect to VM-Series.

## Usage

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file and copy the content of `example.tfvars.sample` into it, adjust if needed.
2. Enter your SSH key pair in the `ssh_key_name` parameter. You will use this later to connnect to the VM-Series management interface.
3. Run the following commands.

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
terraform output -json mgmt_eip
```
4. Use your SSH key to connect the IP address of the VM-Series management interface.

```sh
ssh <username>@<mgmt_eip> -i <path_to_your_private_ssh_key>
```

## Cleanup

To delete all the resources created by the previous `apply` attempts, execute:

```sh
terraform destroy
```
